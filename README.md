## Overview
This Home Assistant integration provides support for ecoMAX controllers manufactured by [Plum Sp. z o.o.](https://www.plum.pl/)

It's based on [PyPlumIO](https://github.com/denpamusic/PyPlumIO) package and supports connection to ecoMAX controller via RS-485 to Ethernet/Wifi converters or via RS-485 to USB adapter.

## Connect the ecoMAX
With this integration you have two ways of connecting to your ecoMAX controller. One is directly connecting the PC that runs Home Assistant via **RS485 to USB adapter**.

Other way is to use **RS485 to WiFi converter**. This has a benefit of being able to move PC that runs Home Assistant away from the boiler and connect to it wirelessly.

![RS485 adapter and converters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denpamusic/homeassistant-plum-ecomax/main/images/rs485.png)

Regardless of the chosen method, you'll need to find RS485 port on your ecoMAX controller.
If you have ecoSTER thermostat, it's easy, as ecoSTERs also use RS485 port and you'll just have to connect your adapter/converter in parallel with it.

If you don't have ecoSTER, look for pins that are labeled as "D+" and "D-" then connect your device as follows:
```
Adapter ->  ecoMAX
[A]     ->  [D+]
[B]     ->  [D-]
[GND]   ->  [GND] (optional, less interference)
```

### ecoNET 300
While this integration is built on top of PyPlumIO library, which from the start was intended as ecoNET 300 alternative, **Patryk B** is currently developing awesome HASS integration that communicates with ecoMAX controller via ecoNET 300 device.

If you have an ecoNET 300 device, be sure to [check it out](https://github.com/pblxptr/ecoNET-300-Home-Assistant-Integration)!

## Installation
### HACS
Click the following My button to install the integration via hacs:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=denpamusic&repository=homeassistant-plum-ecomax&category=integration)

HACS is **recommended** method to install and update the plum-ecomax integration.  
If you still don't use it, give it a try, I'm sure you'll love it!

### Manual

1. Clone this repository with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/denpamusic/homeassistant-plum-ecomax
```

2. Move `custom_components` directory from `homeassistant-plum-ecomax` to your Home Assistant configuration directory. ([next to configuration.yaml](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/))

```sh
cp -r ./homeassistant-plum-ecomax/custom_components ~/.homeassistant
```

3. Add empty `plum_ecomax:` section to your `configuration.yaml` file.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Adding Plum ecoMAX integration to your Home Assistant instance can be done via user interface, by using this My button:

<details>
  <summary><b>Manual Configuration Steps</b></summary>
  
If the above My button doesn’t work, you can also perform the following steps manually:

1. Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
2. In the sidebar click on Settings.
3. From the configuration menu select: Devices & Services.
4. In the bottom right, click on the Add Integration button.
5. From the list, search and select "Plum ecoMAX".

![Search dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denpamusic/homeassistant-plum-ecomax/main/images/search.png)

6. Select you connection type. Choose serial port if your ecoMAX controller is connected directly to the PC that is running Home Assistant, choose network if ecoMAX is connected via RS-485 to WiFi converter

![Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denpamusic/homeassistant-plum-ecomax/main/images/menu.png)

To connect via the network you'll need to fill in Host and Port:

![TCP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denpamusic/homeassistant-plum-ecomax/main/images/tcp.png)

To connect via serial port you'll need to fill in the Device path and Baudrate:

![serial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denpamusic/homeassistant-plum-ecomax/main/images/serial.png)

> :warning: If you're running your Home Assistant in the docker container, don't forget to map your adapter/converter device, as described [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi#exposing-devices).

7. Your device should now be available in your Home Assistant installation.

## Entities
This integration provides the following entities, split between controller device and sub-devices.

Not all entities might be available for your controller model and entities that are deemed as unsupported during
initial setup will be disabled.

ecoMAX pellet boiler controller model names has a "**p**" suffix (e. g. ecoMAX 850p), ecoMAX installation controller model names have an "**i**" suffix (e. g. ecoMAX 850i).

### Water heater
The integration provides full control for the connected indirect water heater using Home Assistant's [internal water heater platform](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/water_heater/).

This includes ability to set target temperature, switch into priority, non-priority mode or turn off.

Please note, that due to the way base water heater entity is implemented,
custom modes [are not allowed](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/water-heater/#states).
Please use the following reference table to convert between water heater operation modes displayed in Home Assistant and ecoMAX.

| HomeAssistant | ecoMAX            |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Off           | On                |
| Performance   | Priority mode     |
| Eco           | Non-priority mode |

### Thermostats
This integration provides Home Assistant's [climate platform](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/climate/) entity for each ecoSTER thermostat connected to the ecoMAX controller.

This allows to check current room temperature, set target room temperature and change between ecoSTER operation modes.

![Climate card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denpamusic/homeassistant-plum-ecomax/main/images/climate-card.png)

### Mixers/Circuits (Sub-devices)
Following section lists entities that are added to each sub-device.

Please note, that for ecoMAX installation ("**i**") controllers mixers are renamed to circuits.

Mixers/Circuits are added as sub-devices for the ecoMAX controller.<br>
Sub-devices detected only once, when integration is added to HomeAssistant.<br>
If you connected them after setting up the integration, you can use `Detect sub-devices` button in Diagnostics section to force detection of new sub-devices.
