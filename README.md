## Overview
This Home Assistant integration provides support for ecoMAX controllers manufactured by [Plum Sp. z o.o.](https://www.plum.pl/)

It's based on [PyPlumIO](https://github.com/denpamusic/PyPlumIO) package and supports connection to ecoMAX controller via RS-485 to Ethernet/Wifi converters or via RS-485 to USB adapter.

## ecoNET 300
While this integration is built on top of PyPlumIO library, which from the start was intended as ecoNET 300 alternative, **Patryk B** is currently developing awesome HASS integration that communicates with ecoMAX controller via ecoNET 300 device.

If you have an ecoNET 300 device, be sure to [check it out](https://github.com/pblxptr/ecoNET-300-Home-Assistant-Integration)!

## Installation
### HACS
1. Follow [this guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories) to add homeassistant-plum-ecomax as custom repository to the HACS.  
URL of the repository:
```
https://github.com/denpamusic/homeassistant-plum-ecomax
```
2. Search for `ecomax` in HACS search window and install `Plum ecoMAX pellet boiler regulator integration`.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Clone this repository with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/denpamusic/homeassistant-plum-ecomax
```

2. Move `custom_components` directory from `homeassistant-plum-ecomax` to your Home Assistant configuration directory. ([next to configuration.yaml](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/))

```sh
cp -r ./homeassistant-plum-ecomax/custom_components ~/.homeassistant
```

3. Add empty `plum_ecomax:` section to your `configuration.yaml` file.
4. Restart Home Assistant.


## Configuration

Adding Plum ecoMAX integration to your Home Assistant instance can be done via user interface, by using this My button:

## Services
This integration provides following services:

### Set parameter
Provides ability to set device/sub-device parameter by name. Any parameter that is supported by the device/sub-device can be used with this service. To get parameter names, please download and open diagnostics data and look for a `parameters` key.

Fields:
- __name__ - parameter name
- __value__ - parameter value (allowed values: positive integer, "on", "off")

Targets (Devices):
- __controller__ (default) - set parameter on the ecoMAX controller itself
- __sub-device__ - set parameter on one of sub-devices (e. g. mixer/circuit)

### Calibrate meter ðŸ‡µ
Allows to set meter to a specific value. Currently this can be used to set a value of a `Total Fuel Burned` sensor.

Targets (Entities):
 - __total_fuel_burned__ - counts total burned fuel in kilograms

Fields:
 - __value__ - target sensor will be set to this value

### Reset meter ðŸ‡µ
Allows to reset the meter value. Can be used to reset a value for the `Total Fuel Burned` sensor.

Targets (Entities):
 - __total_fuel_burned__ - counts total burned fuel in kilograms
