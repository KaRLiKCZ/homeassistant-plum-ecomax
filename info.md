## Overview
This Home Assistant integration provides support for ecoMAX automatic pellet boilers controllers manufactured by [Plum Sp. z o.o.](https://www.plum.pl/)

It's based on [PyPlumIO](https://github.com/denpamusic/PyPlumIO) package and supports connection to ecoMAX controller via RS-485 to Ethernet/Wifi converters or via RS-485 to USB adapter.

## Connect the ecoMAX
With this integration you have two ways of connecting to you ecoMAX controller. One is directly connecting the PC that runs Home Assistant via **RS485 to USB adapter**.

Other way is to use **RS485 to WiFi converter**. This has a benefit of being able to move PC that runs Home Assistant away from the boiler and connect to it wirelessly.

Regardless of the chosen method, you'll need to find RS485 port on your ecoMAX controller.
If you have ecoSTER thermostat, it's easy, as ecoSTERs also use RS485 port and you'll just have to connect your adapter/converter in parallel with it.

If you don't have ecoSTER, look for pins that are labeled as "D+" and "D-" then connect your device as follows:
```
Adapter ->  ecoMAX
[A]     ->  [D+]
[B]     ->  [D-]
[GND]   ->  [GND] (optional, less interference)
```
