## Overview
This Home Assistant integration provides support for ecoMAX automatic pellet boilers controllers manufactured by [Plum Sp. z o.o.](https://www.plum.pl/)

It's based on [PyPlumIO](https://github.com/denpamusic/PyPlumIO) package and supports connection to ecoMAX controller via RS-485 to Ethernet/Wifi converters or via RS-485 to USB adapter.

## Services
This integration provides following services:

### Set parameter
Provides ability to set device/sub-device parameter by name. Any parameter that is supported by the device/sub-device can be used with this service. To get parameter names, please download and open diagnostics data and look for a `parameters` key.

Fields:
- __name__ - parameter name
- __value__ - parameter value (allowed values: positive integer, "on", "off")

Targets (Devices):
- __controller__ (default) - set parameter on the ecoMAX controller itself
- __sub-device__ - set parameter on one of sub-devices (e. g. mixer/circuit)

### Calibrate meter ğŸ‡µ
Allows to set meter to a specific value. Currently this can be used to set a value of a `Total Fuel Burned` sensor.

Targets (Entities):
 - __total_fuel_burned__ - counts total burned fuel in kilograms

Fields:
 - __value__ - target sensor will be set to this value

### Reset meter ğŸ‡µ
Allows to reset the meter value. Can be used to reset a value for the `Total Fuel Burned` sensor.

Targets (Entities):
 - __total_fuel_burned__ - counts total burned fuel in kilograms
