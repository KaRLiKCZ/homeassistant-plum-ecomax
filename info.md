## Overview
This Home Assistant integration provides support for ecoMAX automatic pellet boilers controllers manufactured by [Plum Sp. z o.o.](https://www.plum.pl/)

It is based on [PyPlumIO](https://github.com/denpamusic/PyPlumIO) package and supports connection to ecoMAX controller via serial network server, for example [Elfin EW11](https://aliexpress.ru/item/4001104348624.html).

Support for USB to RS485 converters is currently in early stages of development and largely untested.

This project is currently considered __Pre-Alpha__, please refrain from using it in production.
